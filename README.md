# PlanetSys

This gem is meant to be a very short, informative guide to the planets of the Solar System.  Their Orbital Speed (how fast they go around the sun), their orbital period (how long it takes them to go once around the sun) and their rotational speed (how quickly a day goes by on each planet.).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'planet_sys'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install planet_sys
    
You'll also want to include the gem 'colorize' for a fully immersive experience!  You can accomplish this by typing the following into your terminal!

	$ gem install colorize

Or navigate to this website: https://rubygems.org/gems/colorize/versions/0.8.1

Lastly, you'll want to make sure your terminal window is at least the following parameters for the best viewing experience.
	
	Terminal window: 128 x 38
	

## Usage

This gem is a simple guide to the following three aspects of each (recognized) planet in our Solar System.  

	Orbital Speed: How quickly the planet goes around the Sun.
	Orbital Period: The period it takes to go once around the sun (in Earth years).
	Rotational Speed: How quickly the planet rotates on its axis (in Earth days).

It is designed as a student CLI Project from the Flatiron School of Coding - online platform.
